            <h2 class="head2">What is network assessment?</h2>
            A network assessment is an evaluation or analysis of an existing network infrastructure that helps to identify
            underutilized or overutilized network resources, plan for network upgrades, ensure compliance, and improve
            network performance and security.<br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="head2">What does the network assessment system do?</h2>
            Network assessment software offers a variety of helpful features such as reports, security scans, IT
            inventories, checklists, and more. The software automatically discovers devices and displays maps to help
            administrators monitor the fault, availability,
            and performance of all devices within their network. Network assessment is like a check-up for your network, and
            it is particularly advantageous for businesses without full visibility into their network
        </p>

        <h1 class="head" id="agenda">Agenda</h1><br><hr><br>
        <p>
            The purpose of a network assessment is to identify vulnerabilities, ensure the network is healthy, secure,
            and performing optimally, and to make informed and strategic business decisions. But our primary purpose is
            to make our system usable for people having disabilities along with normal users.

            <h2>Keyboard Navigation:</h2>
            The system would be fully operable using a keyboard, as some users with mobility impairments may not be able to
            use a mouse.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>Alternative Text for visual elements:</h2>
            All visual elements, such as graphs and charts, will have alternative text descriptions to make the content
            accessible to users who are visually impaired.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>Ensuring Compatibility:</h2>
            The system will be compatible with screen readers, magnifiers, and other assistive technologies commonly used by
            individuals with disabilities.<br>
        </p>
        <br><hr><br>
        <h1 class="head" id="acc">Conclusion</h1><br><hr><br>
        <p>
            Network assessing systems are readily available and accessible to organizations of all sizes. It helps in
            automating the process of assessing the network, identifying potential problems, and providing real-time
            insights into the network's health and performance.
            But along with that, our network assessing system can be used by users who have certain disabilities such as
            visual impairment, mobility impairment, and cognitive disabilities.
            Thus, making it accessible to a very wide range of users.
